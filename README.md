# WineNot - Wine Catalog Data Classification

## Project Context

**WineNot** is a company specializing in the distribution of quality wines from different European and Georgian wine regions. 

Our catalog database includes 500 wine references with detailed information (region, grape variety, vintage, tasting notes, price, stock). To improve our business strategy and facilitate inventory analysis, we restructured our catalog by creating an enriched table with business classifications.

## Objective

Create a production table (`WINENOT.PRD.MERGE`) from our raw catalog (`WINENOT.UAT.WINE_CATALOG`) by adding three classification dimensions :

1. **Regional Classification**: Categorization of wines by prestige and geographic origin
2. **Price Classification** : Segmentation into 4 price ranges
3. **Quality Classification**: Evaluation based on critical ratings

## Data Architecture

```
WINENOT (Database)
â”œâ”€â”€ UAT (Schema)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ WINE_CATALOG (Source table - 500 wines)
â””â”€â”€ PRD (Schema)
    â””â”€â”€ WINES (Enriched table with classifications)
```

## ðŸ”§ Transformation SQL Script

### 1. Creation of the enriched table

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE WINENOT.PRD.WINES AS
SELECT 
    -- Original columns
    id,
    reference,
    color,
    country,
    region,
    appellation,
    vintage,
    grapes,
    alcohol_percent,
    bottle_size_l,
    sweetness,
    tannin,
    acidity,
    rating,
    price_eur,
    producer,
    stock_quantity,
    
    -- REGIONAL CLASSIFICATION
    CASE 
        WHEN region = 'Rhone' THEN 'Premium French - Rhone Valley'
        WHEN region = 'Bordeaux' THEN 'Premium French - Bordeaux'
        WHEN region = 'Burgundy' THEN 'Premium French - Burgundy'
        WHEN region = 'Champagne' THEN 'Prestige French - Champagne'
        WHEN region IN ('Loire', 'Alsace', 'Provence', 'Jura', 'Beaujolais', 'Languedoc') 
            THEN 'Regional French'
        WHEN region = 'Rioja' THEN 'Premium Spanish - Rioja'
        WHEN region = 'Ribera del Duero' THEN 'Premium Spanish - Ribera'
        WHEN region = 'Rias Baixas' THEN 'Regional Spanish - Atlantic'
        WHEN region IN ('Tuscany', 'Piedmont') THEN 'Premium Italian - North'
        WHEN region IN ('Sicily', 'Veneto') THEN 'Regional Italian'
        WHEN region = 'Kakheti' THEN 'Georgian Heritage'
        ELSE 'Other'
    END AS region_classification,
    
    -- PRICE CLASSIFICATION
    CASE 
        WHEN price_eur < 15 THEN 'Budget'
        WHEN price_eur BETWEEN 15 AND 30 THEN 'Mid-Range'
        WHEN price_eur BETWEEN 30 AND 50 THEN 'Premium'
        WHEN price_eur >= 50 THEN 'Luxury'
    END AS price_category,
    
    -- QUALITY CLASSIFICATION
    CASE 
        WHEN rating >= 95 THEN 'Exceptional'
        WHEN rating >= 90 THEN 'Excellent'
        WHEN rating >= 85 THEN 'Very Good'
        WHEN rating >= 80 THEN 'Good'
        ELSE 'Average'
    END AS quality_tier

FROM WINENOT.UAT.WINE_CATALOG
ORDER BY region, price_eur DESC;
```

### 2. Record count check

```sql
-- Total amount of wines in the new table
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_wines 
FROM WINENOT.PRD.MERGE;
```

### 3. Inspect transformed data

```sql
-- Snapshot of the first 5 registered wines with classification
SELECT 
    id,
    reference,
    region,
    region_classification,
    price_eur,
    price_category,
    rating,
    quality_tier
FROM WINENOT.PRD.WINES
LIMIT 5;
```

### 4. Distribution analysis by classification

```sql
-- Distribution of wines by region, price, and quality
SELECT 
    region_classification,
    price_category,
    quality_tier,
    COUNT(*) as wine_count,
    ROUND(AVG(price_eur), 2) as avg_price,
    ROUND(AVG(rating), 1) as avg_rating
FROM WINENOT.PRD.WINES
GROUP BY region_classification, price_category, quality_tier
ORDER BY wine_count DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### 5. Exploration by rating

```sql
-- Top 10 wines with the best ratings
SELECT 
    reference,
    producer,
    region_classification,
    vintage,
    rating,
    price_eur,
    quality_tier
FROM WINENOT.PRD.WINES
ORDER BY rating DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Wines with the lowest ratings (quality analysis)
SELECT 
    reference,
    producer,
    region_classification,
    rating,
    price_eur,
    quality_tier
FROM WINENOT.PRD.WINES
ORDER BY rating ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Use Cases

This classification enables:
- **Catalog segmentation** for targeted marketing campaigns
- **Performance analysis** by price range and region
- **Stock optimization** by identifying Premium vs. Budget wines
- **Recommendations building** based on quality/price
- **Simplified reporting** for sales management

## Technologies

- **Snowflake** : Cloud Data Warehouse
- **SQL** : Data transformation language
- **Environment** : UAT â†’ PRD pipeline

## Technical Notes

- Source table contains 500 wine references
- No data was deleted, only enriched
- Classifications are based on business rules defined with the sales team
- The PRD.MERGE table is recreated on each execution (CREATE OR REPLACE)
